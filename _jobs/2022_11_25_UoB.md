Last year some CS students helped to design an activity that we have used at open days, offer-holder days and with our outreach team. It is a digital environment that you can use Java in to program a hot air balloon that can move in 3 dimensions. 

The ideal candidate is comfortable talking to a variety of people and interested in both programming and teaching/delivering workshops. 

The work would involve fixing bugs and developing the environment, as well as delivering the activity to guests of the university who will have a wide range of previous programming experience. 

The pay is Â£13.28 per hour + 12% holiday pay, and you will be paid for time developing and delivering the activity.
