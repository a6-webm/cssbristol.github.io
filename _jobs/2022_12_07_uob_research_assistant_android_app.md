## Company Overview
I'm a senior lecturer in the economics department at the University of Bristol. The research project revolves around an app that lets illiterate individuals in developing countries earn money by performing educational microtasks.

## Job Requirements
Experience with Android app development including backend

## Job Responsibilities
I'm looking for someone to further develop an already existing app I'm using for my research. More information on the current status of the app and what I would like it to do is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OFEqM1Suh58PxWP5Pms7eCuj0sv5HFwihWP2TSyMLzk/edit?usp=sharing
