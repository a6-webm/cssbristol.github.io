**Applications should be sent as soon as possible for the best chance.**

A world leader in smart mobile technologies, Qualcomm offers complete solutions that enable continuous innovation for today's smart connected devices. Our vast expertise in wireless technology, combined with our unique systems approach to developing solutions, puts Qualcomm at the forefront of the rapidly expanding mobile industry.

The IoT Business Unit is a leading player in Internet of Things, Voice and Music and Bluetooth Smart with locations around the world. The business group develops and delivers hardware, software and applications that bring together the very latest wireless and audio technologies to create industry leading audio voice and music products. You will be joining a successful engineering department whose deliveries can be found in billions of Bluetooth and Voice and Music products worldwide.

Based out of Qualcomm’s Bristol office, this role offers 6 months internship position on PHY algorithm development, simulation, implementation, and testing for data communication modems supporting WLAN and BT connectivity standards. The algorithm design will involve both RF/Analog and Digital/Baseband interactions within the modem as well as fixed point implementation.

In this role you will have an opportunity to interact with Systems, Digital and Software teams.

This internship gives you the opportunity to join a world class team (including other interns and recent graduates) in the heart of Bristol’s thriving silicon community. As an intern you will be assigned a mentor to support your progress throughout the year.
