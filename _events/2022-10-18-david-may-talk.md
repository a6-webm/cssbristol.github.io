The Inmos office opened in Bristol in December 1978. This was the starting point for Bristol's microelectronics industry, leading to the development of the Inmos Transputer, the first microcomputer designed for parallel computing. It was used by thousands of researchers and students around the world. It was used both in high-performance computers and consumer products; over 1 billion products incorporating the Inmos technology were shipped. The many highly skilled technologists who joined Inmos went on to form new companies and enabled the region to attract investment from global technology companies.
