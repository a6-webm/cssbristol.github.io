Ever wanted to make a video game? Well, don't wait until after graduation! Join us on Saturday 14th November for a 24-hour Game Jam, and make the best (or worst) game you can! It's a great opportunity to learn and develop your skills, so don't be shy! Plus, there will be prizes involved! ðŸŽ®ðŸ‘¾ðŸ’–

300 person limit - first come first served

Theme: To be revealed on the day...

We will be setting up a Facebook group for the Gamejam in the coming days for further communication on the event and to help people find a group! Once done we will release the sign-up forms for solo's and groups. Don't worry if you're alone though - we'll find a team for you on the day (or if you wanna go solo that's fine too I guess).
