## Motions üìú

Want to change something about CSS?

You can submit a motion [here](https://forms.gle/RwjpVVGyT8Z4CQccA)

Don't worry if you can't attend the AGM - You can still submit a motion.

## Roles üè∑

Apply for a role below! You will have to prepare a manifesto and a 2-minute speech.

Be quick though since the deadline for applications is 8 May at 5pm.

Notes: 

- If you're running for a role but cannot attend the AGM you can send us a recording of your speech or a copy of the text for us to read out.

- You may run for more than one role and you will get to give a speech for every position you are running for if you wish.

- You cannot nominate yourself for treasurer if you are a final-year student in the next academic year unless approved by the SU Societies Network.
