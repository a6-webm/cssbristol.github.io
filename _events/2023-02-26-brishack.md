## THEME: My Utopia

Everyone has their own unique image of what a perfect utopia looks like, so dream up a project that will help us get to what your (or your team's) image of what a Utopian Society looks like!

The sky is the limit with what you can doâ€”we want to see the full breadth of your imagination, from projects tackling economic equality, sustainability issues, social welfare or even creativity and artistic expression; show us how you would want to change the world.

## FAQ

### I'm inexperienced as a programmer, can I still participate?
Of course! Participating in a Hackathon is a great way to get more experience; you can either join a team of more experienced participants and learn from them, or participate yourself and grow from the challenge, and hopefully even gain an awesome portfolio piece by the end of the Hackathon.

Remember, it isn't all about winning; BrisHack is a fun event for you to learn and explore new technologies and areas!

### How do I find a team?
We will be hosting a team-finding event (a social mingle) the week before the Hackathon; watch this space for more details.

Alternatively, post on our discord servers!

### I don't attend the University of Bristol, can I participate?
As long as you are a student aged over eighteen at a university or college in the UK, you are welcome to join!

### Will food be provided?
We're offended you even asked; we always have food! Just make sure to let us know if you have any dietary requirements!

### I don't study a STEM discipline, can I participate?
BrisHack is open to all! If you have even basic technological knowledge, we'd love to see what you make. Alternatively, if you lack technological powress but have an awesome idea, perhaps you can join a team and be their ideas-person

### Do I need to dream up a solution to a huge/very serious problem?
You don't need to solve a huge problem; progress comes in small nudges! If you think you've got the cure to world hunger, that's awesome! But don't be put off entering because you are tackling a small issue; oftentimes it's the focussed solutions that are the most effective.
