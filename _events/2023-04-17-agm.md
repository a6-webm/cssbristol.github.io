You will have a chance to speak for 60s (once, regardless of how many positions you apply for) during the AGM.

If you're abroad this year or can't attend the AGM - don't worry! You can still apply. We recommend recording a short video of yourself speaking so that we can play it at the AGM. If you like, we can read out a written statement instead.

Could you see yourself at the helm of our next Hackathon or Bar Crawl? Being a committee member is a great way to gain experience running events, dealing with industrial sponsors and communications. And to boot - it's a whole lot of fun!
