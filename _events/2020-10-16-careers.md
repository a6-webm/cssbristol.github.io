Have you just started university and want to make sure you'll graduate with a good job? Have you started thinking about a career in software engineering but aren't sure how to go ahead? This talk is for you!

Mykola and Lily will talk about how you can utilise your degree and various schemes employers run to secure internships and grad jobs! Find out the possibilities for a career in technology, the best places to look for opportunities and how to prepare for interviewing.

After the short talk we will run a QnA with Callum Ke (Amazon offer holder) on board as well, so you can ask questions about the various career choices you can make!
