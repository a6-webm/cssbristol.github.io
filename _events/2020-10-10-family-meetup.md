(Note: this event is for first years & CS parents only!)

We'll be matching you up with some older students on your course so you can have someone to talk to for advice & insight into university life, the course, and anything else you'd like to know.

Event better, our ðŸ‘ª world-leading ðŸ‘ª algorithm will match you up with parents best suited to you!

(You will be sent who your parents are and how to connect with them Soonâ„¢)
