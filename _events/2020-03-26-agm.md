Join us for our 2020 AGM where we'll have lots of free pizza and beer, chat about some motions, and most importantly elect the new committee 😮

Do you have what it takes to rise up and take on a role? 🤔
Yes? 😍 I thought so... go on checkout down below for all the roles with their descriptions!

If you’re abroad this year or can’t attend the AGM - don’t worry! You can still nominate yourself/submit a motion. 🎉
Just record a short video of your speech or send us your speech to read out!

Be quick though as the deadline for applications is 25/3 at 7pm. If your application is late it will burn in the deepest depths of hell 😈

Want to change something about CSS?
You can submit a motion [here](https://forms.gle/S716hKQN7tJprfhv6)
