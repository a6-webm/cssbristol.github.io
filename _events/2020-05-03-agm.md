Join us for our first ever Online AGM 😲
It'll be on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nYwbhf8)!

Do you have what it takes to rise up and take on a role? 🤔
Yes? 😍 I thought so... go on checkout down below for all the roles with their descriptions!

If you’re abroad this year or can’t attend the AGM - don’t worry! You can still nominate yourself/submit a motion. 🎉

Be quick though as the deadline for applications is ~~02/05/20 at 7pm~~ **03/05/20 at 1pm**. If your application is late it will burn in the deepest depths of hell 😈

Want to change something about CSS?

You can submit a motion [here](https://forms.gle/S716hKQN7tJprfhv6)

Make sure you join us on our [Minecraft server](https://cssbristol.co.uk/events/2020_03_25_minecraft/)

And chat with us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nYwbhf8)
