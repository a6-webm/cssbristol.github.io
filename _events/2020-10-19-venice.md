Miranda's talk will be on the remarkable and apparently-bizarre 13th Century algorithm that was used to choose the ruler of Venice. It turns out to have some useful properties that weren't noticed for centuries, and to have a link with 21st Century AI.

Miranda Mowbray is an honorary lecturer in the University of Bristol Computer Science Department. Her PhD is in Algebra, from London University. She is interested in Tech Ethics, AI for Cybersecurity, and Italian icecream.
