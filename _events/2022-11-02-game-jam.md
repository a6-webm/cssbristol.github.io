GameJam is back! Team up with your friends (or go it alone, that's fine too!) and join us on 2nd and 3rd November for a 2-day GameJam, where you will compete to make the best game possible with the theme "It's not a Bug It's a Feature"! It's a fantastic opportunity to develop your skills and maybe win a prize! Did we mention that there will be free pizza?
