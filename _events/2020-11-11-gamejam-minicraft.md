A talk by Dr David Bernhard!

A computer scientist should be able to look at any piece of software and explain how to build something like that. In this talk, we'll look at a simple 2D Java open-source game somewhere between Minecraft and Legend of Zelda, using techniques at the level of the first-year TB2 "OOP and Algorithms" unit.

Perfect for Gamejam preperation.
