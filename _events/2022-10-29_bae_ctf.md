**[Sign Up Form:](https://forms.office.com/r/zRDHQxeGHt)** 

BAE Systems are running a Capture the Flag event, a day of cyber security challenges and games, on Saturday 29th October. Anybody who is currently enrolled at The University of Bristol can sign up and play.

**This is a team-based challenge for teams of 2 to 6 players. If you don’t have a team yet then don’t worry – come along anyway as teams will be created on the day.**

The challenges will involve breaking into vulnerable websites, cracking ciphers, forensic searches, reverse engineering and much more. No previous experience of these kinds of challenge is necessary; they are designed for students who like taking things apart and seeing how they work.

We really hope to see you there.
