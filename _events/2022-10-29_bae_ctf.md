**SIGN UP TBA**

BAE Systems are running a Capture the Flag event, a day of cyber security challenges and games, on Saturday 29th October. Anybody who is currently enrolled at The University of Bristol can sign up and play. There are prizes for the winning team and goodies for anyone taking part!

This is a team-based challenge for teams of 2 to 6 players. If you don’t have a team yet then don’t worry – come along anyway as teams will be created on the day.

The challenges will involve breaking into vulnerable websites, cracking ciphers, forensic searches, reverse engineering and much more. No previous experience of these kinds of challenge is necessary; they are designed for students who like taking things apart and seeing how they work.

We will email you to confirm your place, and provide more details about the event and what you need to bring.

We really hope to see you there.
