Want to take some time off in Explore week? Join us for a Computer Science Boardgames session! 

This is for everyone in Computer Science – staff (academics, professional and technical services) and students (Undergrad, Masters and PhD students). There will be a load of short games available, so people can drop in and out of the session as you are available – and there will be games that are easy to pick up and play, so if you are not already into boardgames as a hobby, we will teach you!

There will be cake!
