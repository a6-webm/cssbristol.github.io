Join us for a guest lecture from Prof. Walterio Mayol-Cuevas!
'In this talk I will talk over the importance that Computer Science has on Robotics. Will aim to talk on a few examples to highlight how essential is CS to make machines not just intelligent but also able to act in the world. I will also talk about some of the work past and present going on at CS Bristol and make space for questions and answers from you.'

Prof Walterio Mayol-Cuevas is full Professor of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Bristol UK, and Principal Research Scientist at Amazon USA. His research with students and collaborators proposed some of the earliest versions of applications of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for robotics and augmented reality. And more recently, working on visual understanding for skill in video, new human-robot interaction metaphors and Computer Vision for novel visual sensors.
