Are you a STEM student looking for an opportunity to express your creative and artistic side?

We are excited to invite you to take part in ART-HACK 23
This hackathon is designed for all students from across the faculty, who are interested in experimenting with technology to express yourself. (No art experience needed!) Whether youâ€™re interested in programming, electronics, VR, robotics, or a combination of these. This event will be an opportunity to come together in a small team (or solo), to explore the potential of your technical skills in creative digital and immersive art context.

The themes of the event are "Dreams and Sleep" or "Beauty of order and randomness"

In the lead up to the event, we will be hosting a range of skills workshops to introduce you to the equipment available for the event, this is likely to include, soldering, Arduino and CAD
