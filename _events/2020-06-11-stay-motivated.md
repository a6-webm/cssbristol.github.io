Join us for weekly catch up sessions to share project ideas, help each other fix bugs, and stay motivated during COVID-19!

Just hop onto the [discord server](https://https://discord.gg/nYwbhf8) and join the *STAY MOTIVATED* channels every Monday and Thursday!

There will be two sessions on each day with the first at 14:30-15:30 and the second at 20:00-21:00

These sessions will be running until in person lectures return!
