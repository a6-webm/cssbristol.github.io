Join us for a discussion with Mihkel Aamer, Bristol alumnus and Co-Founder at Lightyear, a new FinTech investing startup with super low fees. Mikhel will be discussing his experience within technology and finance, with potential for free prizes and merchandise! Pizza and drinks will also be provided after the event! 

Mihkel graduated from Bristol after completing both his BA and Masters at the university. He joined UBS as a Software Engineer before moving to Wise (formerly TransferWise) as one of their very first engineers, going on to build and lead the engineering team from the ground up to hundreds of global employees. After leaving Wise, Mihkel together with co-founder Martin Sokk, started Lightyear to build a better investment platform for Europe.
