**For the first time since Sir Adam Deegan was president the fabled FREE CSS Barbeque has returned!**

Join us for some food and music to celebrate the end of another year! There will also be a tug of war and other fun activities available!
Anyone is able to come however a ticket is required to get food since we need to order it in advance.
Halal and vegan food will be provided.
We are unable to provide alcohol but you are free to bring your own :)

[Remember to book your free ticket through Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-return-of-the-css-barbecue-tickets-345102570077)
