AND SHOW YOUR VIRTUAL HAND IN THREE... TWO ...ONE! Damn it a draw again?!

Are the odds in your favour?

If so why not take part in our virtual Rock Paper Scissors event on Saturday, where you will be competing against others in the game estimated to be 2226 years old (originating from around 206 BC – 220 AD).  Come to the CSS discord Server on the day to register yourself into the tournament to compete to win a whooping £100 first-place prize, if that's not a big enough incentive then how about turning up for the fun of it!
Depending on our bracketing system and numbers the tournament could take 10 minutes - 1 hour.
