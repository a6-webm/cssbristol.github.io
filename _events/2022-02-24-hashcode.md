Join us to take part in Google's anual coding competition: Hashcode.
Work in a team and chat with us on Discord!

Hash Code is a team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world. You pick your team and programming language and we pick an engineering problem for you to solve. This year's contest kicks off with an Online Qualifications, where your team can compete virtually from wherever you'd like, alongside your virtual Hub. Top teams will then be invited to compete from our virtual World Finals.
